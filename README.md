Library Manager
===============

# Read Me First
This is a simple library application with REST APIs to manage the books in the library and book rentals.

We have three rules:

1- A book can have multiple copies in the library.
2- If a book destroyed, this book could not rental.
3- An user can rent maximum five books at the same time.
